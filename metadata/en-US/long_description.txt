Markdownr converts an URL to markdown, and lets you share it to your favorite notes app.

I've written this app to save articles I found interesting to a note taking app that uses markdown and git to sync notes to my pc.

Features:

- Downloads the web page specified in the URL input field and converts it to Markdown
- Share the markdown to other apps with standard share intent
- The URL can be also be shared from another app (for example the web browser);
  markdownr will automatically convert it and show the share intent.
